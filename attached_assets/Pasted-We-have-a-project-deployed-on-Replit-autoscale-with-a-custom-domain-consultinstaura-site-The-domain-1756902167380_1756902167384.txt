We have a project deployed on Replit autoscale with a custom domain consultinstaura.site.
The domain DNS records are set and verified, but the site is returning a 500-like error.
On some devices it works (especially new ones), on others it fails.

Please help me check the following, step by step:

1. Container health and crash logs
Check the build and runtime logs for errors on startup or when serving requests.
Confirm there are no missing dependencies, syntax errors, or environment variables.

2. Port binding
Verify the app is listening on process.env.PORT (or $PORT in Python/Flask) and host 0.0.0.0.
If the code uses a hard-coded port like 3000 or binds to localhost, fix it.

3. Environment variables and secrets
Ensure all required secrets (API keys, database URLs, etc.) are set in the Replit Secrets panel.
Missing or incorrect values often cause a crash at first request.

4. Domain configuration
Confirm the custom domain consultinstaura.site is mapped correctly in Replit.
Check that the verified DNS records (CNAME, AAAA, A) match what Replit expects.
Make sure there is no old record cached that points to a previous deployment.

5. SSL and redirect issues
Ensure the app itself is not trying to handle HTTPS or redirect between HTTP and HTTPS in a way that conflicts with Replit SSL termination.
Look for infinite redirect loops or certificate mismatches.

6. DNS cache
Test the project via its default Replit URL https://instaura-site-adityashelar120.replit.app
If the default URL works but the custom domain does not, flush DNS cache locally and try different networks.
If it still fails, the issue is likely DNS propagation or misconfiguration.

Commands and checks to run in the Shell:
echo $PORT to confirm the PORT value.
netstat -tulpn or equivalent to confirm the process is listening on that port.
curl -v https://instaura-site-adityashelar120.replit.app to verify the service responds directly.
curl -v https://consultinstaura.site to compare response and headers for mismatch.

Goal: isolate whether the error is in the app (crashing), in the port binding, or in the domain or SSL layer, and fix accordingly.
